# arithmetic operators and their commented function
# +, -, *, /, %, **, //, &, |, ^, <<, >>
# a = 10
# b = 5
# print(a + b) # addition
# print(a - b) # subtraction
# print(a * b) # multiplication
# print(a / b) # division
# print(a % b) # modulus
# print(a ** b) # power
# print(a // b) # floor division
# print(a & b) # bitwise and
# print(a | b) # bitwise or
# print(a ^ b) # bitwise xor
# print(a << b) # left shift
# print(a >> b) # right shift


# comparison operators and their commented function
# ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=
# a = 10
# b = 5
# print(a == b) # checks if a is equal to b
# print(a != b) # checks if a is not equal to b
# print(a > b) # checks if a is greater than b
# print(a < b) # checks if a is less than b
# print(a >= b) # checks if a is greater than or equal to b
# print(a <= b) # checks if a is less than or equal to b


# logical operators and their commented function
# and, or, not
# a = 10
# b = 5
# print(a and b) # if both are true then true else false
# print(a or b) # if any one is true then true else false
# print(not a) # if true then false else true

# 7 + 4
# here 7 and 4 are operands and + is operator and 11 will be  the result
